# Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability:

We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security vulnerabilities responsibly. Instead of opening a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities, please email [trevor@nerdware.cloud](mailto:trevor@nerdware.cloud) with the bug report.

In order for us to best respond to your report, please include any of the following:

- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Any relevant tools, including versions used
- Tool output

Thank you!
